My background is medicine, not computer science, and it shows: the code is ugly and needs a lot of optimisation, but it works...

This repo is forked and modified from Wu et al. / NYU's [nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier](https://github.com/nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier)
under the terms of the GNU AGPLv3 license.
 
This is largely a personal development repo for our paper 'Replication of deep learning for screening mammography: Reduced performance mitigated by retraining on local data*, availalble in preprint at [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.28.21257892v1)
in which we show that retraining a convolutional neural network (a type of artificial intelligence) developed at New York University, using local data, can improve breast cancer diagnosis in mammograms. 

We are not able to share the BSSA data, or models at this time. 

Formal publication is pending. We will add more information here, once published.
